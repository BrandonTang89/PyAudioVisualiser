--AudioVisualiserGUI.exe--
Thanks for looking at this :)

Download both AudioVisualiserGUI.exe and lame.exe into the SAME directory
The file path is relative to AudioVisualiserGUI.exe
Only accepts .mp3 and .wav encoded audio files

Entertainment version looks nicer
Normal Version shows proper frequency spectrogram
